# savvy-space-backend-sql

This project uses an external database hosted by AWS Relation Database Services.
The code uses Node.js with Express for the routing and uses the 'mysql' node package to access the database.
There is also a single-use function that will build the database from scratch using javascript and a JSON object.

The backend has the capability to further edit the information that what is seen on the frontend UI.
It uses basic CRUD operations written in SQL and ran by the mysql package.
